ChildConsole is a console emulator designed to familiarize children with the command-line interface. I originally developed this console for my 5-year-old brother (2022), and realizing its potential benefit for others, I decided to share the code on GitHub.

### Educational Purpose

The `ls` command in ChildConsole displays a list of simple two and three-letter commands. Encourage children to recognize and identify these commands on the list and practice typing them on the keyboard.

### Manual Page

To learn more about how to use the ChildConsole, type `man` or visit the online manual at: [local/man/README](local/man/README)
