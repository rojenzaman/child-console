## ChildConsole>

I made this console emulator for children to get used to the black screen.

I actually wrote this console for my 5 year old brother. I decided to put the code on Github as I thought others might benefit as well.

### Teaching

When you type `ls` command, you will see two and three letter commands listed. Ask the child to perceive the listed commands and find and type them on the keyboard.

### Manual Page

Type `man` or read: [local/man/README](local/man/README)
